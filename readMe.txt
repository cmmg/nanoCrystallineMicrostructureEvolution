Grain Growth coupled with mechanics. Both small strain and finite strain models are implemented. Use flag 'isFiniteStrain' in file "parameters.h" to switch between finiteStrain and smallStrain. For 2D and 3D, use "DIMS".
Plane stress model is used for 2D problem.
In 3D rotation is considered only about z-axis for simplicity.
A multigrain model with 40 grains and 6 order parameters, with orientations either 0 or 90, tested for finite strain and small strain.
